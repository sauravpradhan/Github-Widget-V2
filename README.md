# Github-Widget-V2
=============
A widget to show your recently starred repo in Github.

How it works?
=============
Currently I'm just fetching the starred repo using Github's REST for starred repo.
Anybody can modify the code to work with any REST API with JSON response(of same JSON structure).

How to setup the widget to show your stars:
=============
1) Install the apk from : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byaspar4S5SEUWlocXZlZ24wRU0/view?usp=sharing
2) From Widget Choose GithubWidget and apply.
3) In configuration screen enter your github username and press Configure and wait for some time.

Directly test the APK with my starred repo link:
